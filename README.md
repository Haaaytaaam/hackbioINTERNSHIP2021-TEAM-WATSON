Task 0: 


The Spreadsheet project

Each team should create a GitHub repo. 

Add a comprehensive readme.md with essential information about the internship, the team, the contributors, pictures if possible using markdown.

Each team will work on a minimum of  7 different programming languages

For each person in a team, pick one of the 7 programming languages, Write a script that prints your name, your email, your slack username (with @) and your biostack in that order.

Push the script to your team’s git repo

Collaboratively as a team, develop a bash script that clones the git repo, and generates a CSV file from all the outputs of your team’s scripts

Submit your team’s GitHub link to only the bash script 

Only the emails and slack handles that are on the CSV sheet generated by your script will be promoted to stage 1
